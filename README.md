# lstm_chatbot_by_team_tazeen
created an lstm chatbot using pre trained model on corpus movie dataset.
LSTM-Based Chatbot
Overview
This repository hosts an LSTM-based chatbot model developed using TensorFlow. The model is designed to understand and generate responses based on movie dialogues. The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture helps in capturing long-range dependencies in text, making it suitable for conversation modeling.

Dataset
The chatbot was trained using a subset of the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus. Due to computational constraints and to streamline the development process, only a small portion of the dataset was utilized. This subset includes dialogues that cover a wide range of conversational topics, providing a robust foundation for the chatbot's language capabilities.

Model
The model architecture comprises of two main components:

Encoder LSTM: Processes the input query and encodes the information into a context vector.
Decoder LSTM: Takes the context vector and generates a response based on the learned dialogue patterns.
The encoder and decoder are built using LSTM layers, which help maintain the context over longer input sequences.

Installation
To run this model locally, you need to install the necessary dependencies. You can install them using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To interact with the chatbot, use the provided Jupyter notebooks which include detailed steps on how to input a query and receive a response. Alternatively, if you're integrating this model into a Python script, you can load the model and use it as follows:

python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load the model
model = load_model('path_to_model.h5')

# Function to encode the input and decode the output
def chat(input_query):
    encoded_query = encode_input(input_query)
    response = decode_sequence(encoded_query)
    return response

# Example query
response = chat("Hello, how are you?")
print(response)
